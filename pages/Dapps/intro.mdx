# KeepKey: Your Gateway to Decentralized Applications (DApps)

KeepKey simplifies the way you interact with decentralized applications (DApps). Utilize our in-app browser for straightforward access to various DApps, and rest assured in the security of our wallet-connect integration when signing transactions. The in-app browser is designed to guarantee that you are always engaging with the authentic version of the application you wish to use.

## Introduction to DApps

Decentralized applications, or DApps, are autonomous software that operate on a blockchain network, governed by pre-established smart contracts. These DApps form the foundation of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem—a rapidly expanding market currently valued in the hundreds of billions. With KeepKey, your entry into this DeFi space is secure, enabling you to participate in a wide array of activities including but not limited to decentralized lending, stablecoin issuance, multi-chain swapping, and liquidity pooling. From exchanges to gaming, high-stakes investment opportunities to governance, and beyond—KeepKey's built-in DApp Store and in-app browser provide a reliable and user-friendly portal to this innovative landscape.

## The DApp Store Experience

The KeepKey Desktop client features an integrated DApp Store, curated to help you discover and engage with a diverse selection of decentralized applications.

Here's a glimpse of what our DApp Store offers: a highlight section for featured applications showcasing new and exciting DApps, complemented by a searchable directory of popular and widely-used DApps.
